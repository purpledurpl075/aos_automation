AOS Automation

Built for issuing or displaying configuration on Aruba AOS or OS-CX Switches, currently it's not threaded or set to handle exceptions.
Its built to read from ips.txt, which you can create and fill in each ip/fqdn per line. Simply launch the script and supply working credentials, followed by configuration commands.
